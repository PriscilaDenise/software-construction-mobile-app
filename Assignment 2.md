## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROGRAMMING AND SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION
- Programming focuses on writing code to solve a specific problem. It mainly involves implementation of algorithms, writing functions and ensuring the code works correctly. 

- Software construction includes programming  as well as system design, documentation, testing, version control, collaboration, maintenance and deployment. The goal is to produce code which is reliable and maintainable.
